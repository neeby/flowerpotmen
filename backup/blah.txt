- signup new user creates 2 new users (added through user tab just adds 1 entry)
- DB needs primary key (userName)
- occaisional login doesn't show correct position - may be my fat fingers typo - check if handles incorrect userName/password 
		- nope incorrect password handled
		- looks like fat fingers with username incorrect
- dead links
	-Admins
	-Staff
- edit users doesn't update
- delete users doesn't work - done but needs neatening
-property search works but currently Exact match only => returnShortPropertyList  - done
	- currectly select option for filter - split to enable multiple filters to be applied
- CRUD seems to be working correctly but needs ability to hide/disable links to tasks that the user doesn't have access to.
